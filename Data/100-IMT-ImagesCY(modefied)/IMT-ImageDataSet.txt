Database Description:
In the IMT-Segmentation folder there are 100 folders representing data for each patient (100 patients).
In each patient folder we have the follwing:
1) Manual Segmentation folder: Contains initial manual delineation by the doctor. All info are included in the*.scl files. The delineation/s can 
be loaded into matlab i.e load(file.scl, '-.mat'); Then points can be drawn on the image as follows:

An examble how to load an image and display the deliniations (Run the following in Matlab):

a=imread('AAAAA.cri'); load ('AAAAA.scl', '-mat');
figure, imshow(a);
x_int=Param_3(1:2:end-1);
y_int=Param_4(1:2:end-1);
line(x_int,y_int,'LineWidth',1,'Color',[1 1 0],'Marker','x','MarkerEdgeColor',[1 0 0]);
intima=[ x_int, y_int];
x_med=Param_3(2:2:end);
y_med=Param_4(2:2:end);
media=[x_med, y_med];

line(x_med,y_med,'LineWidth',1,'Color',[1 1 0],'Marker','x','MarkerEdgeColor',[1 0 0]);
snpoints=[intima', fliplr(media')];
